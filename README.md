# Stack Navigator 6x fail on React 71.8

Hi, 
this repo contains a plain react native init app of version 71.8 with 2 basic pages & react navigation 6x packages that are available from yarn as of this date, which is 12 May, 2023. the stack navigator renders only the header & not any body. This occured while updating our main app too. For berevity's sake, I created a simple app & added the same react navigation packages. Same thing happened
